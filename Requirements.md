Create an Overall Evaluation Report for the application containing:

why you chose the test cases to automate
any other additional information you would like to add, e.g. risks, recommendations, approach, etc.
Implement an automatic test report that must be generated after the tests run. (See requirements for automated tests below)
Add clear README file containing:
how to run the test cases/suite (assume the reader does not know your coding language)
how to access the generated report
Candidates for CS position:

Nice to have
Suggestions for improvements

CI/CD scripts in any tool (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Travis CI, etc..)
Add more tests in addition to mandatory ones that will show us how do you approach test automation, which cases prefer to automate, why. If any of additional tests should be failing because of existing bugs, please mention them explicitly in evaluation report.
Framework modules that can demonstrate your skills in the design and implementation of testing frameworks, e.g. layers, design patterns, or other architectural decisions. Please hold the balance of solution complexity vs tasks being solved, do not overengineer
